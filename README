Minimal set of build inststructions:

cd src
autoscan
cd ..
autoconf
./configure
make

Minimal set of execution instructions:

mkdir /foo1/data
mkdir /foo2/history
mkdir /foo3/meta

./elham -data /foo1/data -history /foo2/history -meta /foo3/meta

Minimal mounting instructions:

Make sure to disable as much client side caching as possible if
going across the wire.

Solaris:
mount -o noac,forcedirectio,rw,bg,hard,intr,noquota,vers=3,proto=tcp blah:/vol/data /t/blah/data

Linux:
mount -o noac,rw,bg,hard,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192 blah:/vol/data /t/blah/data

One of my todo's is to enable ODIRECT support in Linux.  If you want, add
it locally.

Mininal warnings about what you are about to do:

ElHam stresses filesystems.  It seeks to find corruption.  It may inadvertantly
cause corruption, especially if you mount filesystems incorrectly.  You may
have to run fsck or its equivalent.

So, be very careful running this program on production systems or ones with
data your care about.

Also, ElHam seeks to fill the filesystems to capacity, back off, and do it
again.  Try and put the 3 different directories on different filesystems.
